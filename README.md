# Tic Tac Toe

The Tic Tac Toe program is a simple command-line version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java.

## Rules of the Game

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns to mark spaces in the grid with their respective symbols, either "X" or "O".
3. The goal is to get three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid.
4. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.

## How to Play

1. The game will display an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2. Player 'X' plays first. To make a move, enter a slot number where you want to place your symbol ('X' or 'O'). The slot numbers range from 1 to 9 and correspond to the positions on the board as shown below:

    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    |---|---|---|
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    
3. Players take turns until there is a winner or the game ends in a draw.
4. The game will display the final result and end.
